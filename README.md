# Rubik
A Rubik's cube in Unity.  This is my first attempt at an Unity Project.

## Version 1: Status Complete
Cube works.  
Arrow keys change Point of View by 90 deg instantly.  
W Key - Rotates White side.  
Y Key - Rotates Yellow side.  
R Key - Rotates Red side.  
O Key - Rotates Orange side.  
B Key - Rotates Blue side.  
G Key - Rotates Green side.  
Space Bar - Changes rotation from clockwise to counter-clockwise (again is vice verse).

## Version 2: Status Complete
Now has Background.  
Rotations are now smoother (takes time instead of instant).  
On screen buttons for convenience.  
Shuffle function to mix up Cube.  
Rear Camera to view back of Cube.  

## Version 3: Status Complete
Added background music.  
Added sound effects.  
P Key - Now Open and Closes Menu for Main Scene.  

## Version 4: Planned
Add Solve Functions.
