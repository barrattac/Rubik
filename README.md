# Rubik
A Rubik's cube in Unity.  This is my first attempt at an Unity Project.

# Version 1: Status Complete
Cube works.  
Arrow keys change Point of View by 90 deg instancely.  
W Key - Rotates White side.  
Y Key - Rotates Yellow side.  
R Key - Rotates Red side.  
O Key - Rotates Orange side.  
B Key - Rotates Blue side.  
G Key - Rotates Green side.  
Space Bar - Changes rotation from clockwise to counter-clockwise (again is vice verse).

# Version 2: Planned
Add Background.  
Make rotations smooth (take time instead of instance).  
Add on screen buttons for convenience.  
Add Shuffle function.
